# Readme

Simple Project to light up an Cupboard in the dark.
It works but the code could be nicer and more maintainable but yeah it works.

## Materials
* Arduino (I use a pro Mini)
* Photoresistor
* PIR Sensor
* WS2812B LED's
* Powersupply (if you use not to much LED's an USB-Charger will be enough)
